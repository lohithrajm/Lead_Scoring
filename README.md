# Problem Statement:

* An education company named X Education, which sells online courses to industry professionals, wants to identify hot leads from initial pool of leads.
*  The sales team would then focus on the hot leads, and would try and convert all the hot leads through regular e-mail and phone call conversations.
*  For the identification of the hot leads the company needs a model which assigns lead score to each lead based on the probability of a lead getting converted.
*  The sales team has been given a target of 80% conversion rate from the current rate of around 30%. The model needs to assist sales team in achieving this.
* For this purpose, a logistic regression model is built.
